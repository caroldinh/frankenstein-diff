As a child I scribbled; and my favourite pastime&comma; during the hours given me for recreation&comma; was to &quot;write stories.&quot; Still I had a dearer pleasure than this&comma; which was the formation of castles in the air—the indulging in waking dreams—the following up trains of thought&comma; which had for their subject the formation of a succession of imaginary incidents. My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings. In the latter I was a close imitator—rather doing as others had done&comma; than putting down the suggestions of my own mind. What I wrote was intended at least for one other eye—my childhood's companion and friend; but my dreams were all my own; I accounted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed—my dearest pleasure when free.<br><br>I lived principally in the country as a girl&comma; and passed a considerable time in Scotland. I made occasional visits to the more picturesque parts; but my habitual residence was on the blank and dreary northern shores of the Tay&comma; near Dundee. Blank and dreary on retrospection I call them; they were not so to me then. They were the eyry of freedom&comma; and the pleasant region where unheeded I could commune with the creatures of my fancy. I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house&comma; or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near&comma; that my true compositions&comma; the airy flights of my imagination&comma; were born and fostered. I did not make myself the heroine of my tales. Life appeared to me too common-place an affair as regarded myself. I could not figure to myself that romantic woes or wonderful events would ever be my lot; but I was not confined to my own identity&comma; and I could people the hours with creations far more interesting to me at that age&comma; than my own sensations.<br><br>After this my life became busier&comma; and reality stood in place of fiction.

At this time he desired that I should write&comma; not so much with the idea that I could produce any thing worthy of notice&comma; but that he might himself judge how far I possessed the promise of better things hereafter. Still I did nothing. Travelling&comma; and the cares of a family&comma; occupied my time; and study&comma; in the way of reading&comma; or improving my ideas in communication with his far more cultivated mind&comma; was all of literary employment that engaged my attention.<br><br>In the summer of 1816&comma; we visited Switzerland&comma; and became the neighbours of Lord Byron. At first we spent our pleasant hours on the lake&comma; or wandering on its shores; and Lord Byron&comma; who was writing the third canto of Childe Harold&comma; was the only one among us who put his thoughts upon paper. These&comma; as he brought them successively to us&comma; clothed in all the light and harmony of poetry&comma; seemed to stamp as divine the glories of heaven and earth&comma; whose influences we partook with him.<br><br>But it proved a wet&comma; ungenial summer&comma; and incessant rain often confined us for days to the house. Some volumes of ghost stories&comma; translated from the German into French&comma; fell into our hands. There was the History of the Inconstant Lover&comma; who&comma; when he thought to clasp the bride to whom he had pledged his vows&comma; found himself in the arms of the pale ghost of her whom he had deserted. There was the tale of the sinful founder of his race&comma; whose miserable doom it was to bestow the kiss of death on all the younger sons of his fated house&comma; just when they reached the age of promise. His gigantic&comma; shadowy form&comma; clothed like the ghost in Hamlet&comma; in complete armour&comma; but with the beaver up&comma; was seen at midnight&comma; by the moon's fitful beams&comma; to advance slowly along the gloomy avenue. The shape was lost beneath the shadow of the castle walls; but soon a gate swung back&comma; a step was heard&comma; the door of the chamber opened&comma; and he advanced to the couch of the blooming youths&comma; cradled in healthy sleep. Eternal sorrow sat upon his face as he bent down and kissed the forehead of the boys&comma; who from that hour withered like flowers snapt upon the stalk. I have not seen these stories since then; but their incidents are as fresh in my mind as if I had read them yesterday.<br><br>&quot;We will each write a ghost story&comma;&quot; said Lord Byron; and his proposition was acceded to. There were four of us. The noble author began a tale&comma; a fragment of which he printed at the end of his poem of Mazeppa. Shelley&comma; more apt to embody ideas and sentiments in the radiance of brilliant imagery&comma; and in the music of the most melodious verse that adorns our language&comma; than to invent the machinery of a story&comma; commenced one founded on the experiences of his early life. Poor Polidori had some terrible idea about a skull-headed lady&comma; who was so punished for peeping through a key-hole—what to see I forget—something very shocking and wrong of course; but when she was reduced to a worse condition than the renowned Tom of Coventry&comma; he did not know what to do with her&comma; and was obliged to despatch her to the tomb of the Capulets&comma; the only place for which she was fitted. The illustrious poets also&comma; annoyed by the platitude of prose&comma; speedily relinquished their uncongenial task.<br><br>I busied myself to think of a story&comma;—a story to rival those which had excited us to this task. One which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature&comma; and awaken thrilling horror—one to make the reader dread to look round&comma; to curdle the blood&comma; and quicken the beatings of the heart. If I did not accomplish these things&comma; my ghost story would be unworthy of its name. I thought and pondered—vainly. I felt that blank incapability of invention which is the greatest misery of authorship&comma; when dull Nothing replies to our anxious invocations. Have you thought of a story", 812

In all matters of discovery and invention&comma; even of those that appertain to the imagination&comma; we are continually reminded of the story of Columbus and his egg. Invention consists in the capacity of seizing on the capabilities of a subject&comma; and in the power of moulding and fashioning ideas suggested to it.<br><br>Many and long were the conversations between Lord Byron and Shelley&comma; to which I was a devout but nearly silent listener. During one of these&comma; various philosophical doctrines were discussed&comma; and among others the nature of the principle of life&comma; and whether there was any probability of its ever being discovered and communicated. They talked of the experiments of Dr. Darwin&comma; (I speak not of what the Doctor really did&comma; or said that he did&comma; but&comma; as more to my purpose&comma; of what was then spoken of as having been done by him&comma;) who preserved a piece of vermicelli in a glass case&comma; till by some extraordinary means it began to move with voluntary motion.
